## Accelerated Mobile Pages Beginner Course

This repo contains the starting point of the AMP Beginner Course. It's just a simple HTML page with no styles at all, and no AMP tags/links/scripts. 

However, it contains everything that is needed for the final version of the site at the end of Advanced Exercises (data list, server code, images/assets, etc).

The app is hosted on Glitch at the following address:

A link to the instructions will be provided as soon as they are published. Check back for updates soon.
